\section{General Purpose Computing on GPUs}
\label{section:gpuarch}

A GPU is a highly parallel programmable processor, that is built to perform the same instruction on a set of data, belonging to the category of processors of \textit{Single Instruction Multiple Data} - SIMD or SIMT?  These were first developed with the processing of computer graphics and images, with the intent of computing all the pixels that compose an image simultaneously. 

With the increase in performance of these devices and the appearance of new types of computation workloads, such as computer simulations, machine learning, and data analysis applications, that could benefit from the parallel nature of GPUs, these started to be used in general-purpose computing, coining the term GPGPU - General-Purpose Graphical Processing Unit.

\subsection{General Overview of GPU Architecture}

The architecture of the GPU can be roughly divided into the Streaming Multiprocessors and on the Memory.
